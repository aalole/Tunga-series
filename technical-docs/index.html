                        According to The Nation,"Olumirin waterfall was
                        discovered by hunters in 1140 AD". Another source has it that the tourist site was discovered by
                        a woman called Akinla, founder of
                        Erin-Ijesha town and a grand-daughter of Oduduwa, during the migration of Ife people to
                        Erin-Ijesa.

                    <li>
                        Erin-Ijesa was founded circa 1140AD by the great Akinla, the first daughter and a princess
                        of Oduduwa, father of the Yorubas, who left Ile-Ife in the 12th century during the
                        tumultuous years that witnessed the dispersal of all heirs and heiresses of Oduduwa.

                        Erin-Ijesa is about 10 kilometres north of Ilesa.
                        It is the chief city of the Ijesa, a
                        sub-nationality of the Yoruba and along the Lagos-Ibadan-Ilesa-Akure-Benin express road.
                        Erin-Ijesa can be described as an ancient, sedate and relatively small and sleepy
                        countryside, which has grown in spatial and demographic terms than it used to be during
                        pre-colonial times.

                        As part of South Western Nigeria, the area falls within the tropical climatic belt, with
                        alternating hot/dry and a warm humid season. Atmospheric temperatures range slightly from 30 –
                        34 degree Celsius, while annual rainfall averages 1500cm. Erin Garden is a thick forest, which
                        houses Olumirin Water Falls. The waterfall is 2km off Erin Ijesha town, which is a few
                        kilometres east of Ilesa town on the Ilesa-Akure Road.

                    Erin-Ijesa is blessed with beautiful landscape with projecting

                    rocks and evergreen deciduous forest. It is also interspersed by big trees like ‘Iroko’,
                    ‘Arere’, ‘Oganwo’, etc; which of course provided opportunities for timber business and
                    saw-milling.

                        There are, in addition,
                        several streams and brooks many of which are however seasonal. Some of these are Agbaroko,
                        Ogburugburu, Ayinrin, Mojapa, Osun, Onisooro, Asiko, and Ajimoloko. These streams and brooks can
                        be used for fishery ponds. A cliff is formed along the course of the Olumirin river creating a
                        waterfall which is a major tourist attraction for many people all over Nigeria and the world in
                        general. Olumirin waterfalls have placed Erin-Ijesa on a roadmap of development. The waterfall
                        is one of the most important tourist centres in Osun State. The epithet of Osun State “Land of
                        the Living Spring” is derived from the waterfalls at Erin-Ijesa and Osun River grove in Osogbo.

                        The awe-inspiring fall, also known as Erin-Ijesha Waterfalls is an assemblage of seven distinct
                        cascades located on the south western slopes of the lush Effon Ridge, in Erin-Ijesha town, Osun
                        state Nigeria. The gigantic Ridge constitutes a conspicuous eye-catcher for every traveller
                        along the Ilesa-Akure expressway, as it towers into the distant skyline, forming a spectacular
                        backrest for the sleepy towns of Erin-Ijesha and Erinmo in Osun state.

                        Seven layers of rocks and seven waterfalls. The water flows majestically among the rocks and
                        splashes down with great force on the vegetation around.
                        This is the most visited tourist site in Nigeria today. Over 100,000 visitors between January
                        and November in 2015, no other tourist site has had that level of patronage.
                        It’s believed by people of Erin-Ijesa that the waterfalls exude from a big pot located at the
                        top of the ridge.

                    The waterfall is a whole new exciting and awe inspiring experience with nature. Each step of the
                    waterfall has a flowing fountain that marks the mystical nature of the place. The Olumirin
                    Waterfall is one of natural wonders of the world. At the outset, you will find nothing unique,
                    but as you climb the uphill plain, which is on seven levels, you will have breathtaking views of
                    nature, boundless amount of nature stored.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At all the levels, the views are spectacular; you will also find the water refreshing. However
                    the seventh level is somewhat difficult to climb, as you will find even the third level equal to
                    trudging the snow-white sharp Mount Everest .

                    Erin Ijesa Waterfall, also known as Olumirin Waterfall is not only a site to behold; it is also
                    one of the wonders of the world. The water flows among rocks and splashes down with great force
                    to the evergreen vegetation around. The area can also serve as a mountaineering exercise. The
                    breeze at the waterfalls is cool and refreshing. The whole scenery is fascinating and idyllic.

                    Direct benefits derived from the waterfall include: drinking water, irrigation for agricultural
                    land, tourism activities, fishing and it has contributed significantly to the overall well
                    -being of the people of the area.

                <p>
                    It was discovered that the full potentials of the waterfall are yet to be harnessed due to lack
                    of commitment from stakeholders especially the Government to invest in the development of the
                    waterfall. Developing the waterfall will not only be a source of revenue to the government, it
                    will equally generate substantial employment, thus reducing the burden of unemployment in the
                    State and the Country at large.

                        Often times, first time tourist at the waterfalls unconsciously starts to number the waterfalls
                        from the last drop (the base of the ridge) as it is the first of all the falls to be encountered
                        when visiting; whereas the numbering is supposed to be from the top. Nevertheless, going by
                        layman’s standard, the seventh drop of the waterfalls is the first waterfall.
